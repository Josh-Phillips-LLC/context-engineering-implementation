# Governance-to-Implementation Boundary

This repository consumes governance contracts and must not redefine governance-authoritative policy.

## Authoritative Source

- Governance repository: `Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-governance`

## Non-Goals in This Repository

- Redefining role authority policy
- Redefining protected-path approval rules
- Redefining ADR schema/lifecycle policy

## Allowed Changes Here

- Tooling implementation details (scripts/workflows/generators)
- Execution automation
- Compatibility wiring to governance contract artifacts
