# Role Charters (Canonical)

## Purpose
- Provide durable, role-first job descriptions for the context system.
- Keep tool names as assignment metadata, not role identity.

## Scope
- Canonical HR roles for Context-Engineering.
- Charters are reference material for responsibilities and escalation.

## Precedence
- If any charter conflicts with governance.md, governance.md is authoritative.

## Naming Convention
- Lowercase kebab-case file names (example: executive-sponsor.md).

## How To Use
- Start with the template in 10-templates/role-charters/_template-role-charter.md.
- Keep charters concise and role-focused.
- Add TODOs where human judgment or thresholds are required.
